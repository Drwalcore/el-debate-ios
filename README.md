# EL Debate

EL Debate is a platform by [@elpassion](https://www.elpassion.com/) to run an anonymous poll featuring yes-no-undecided question. This repository contains source code powering the iOS client.

### Best practices

The project showcases a couple of good engineering practices:

* [x] Continuous Deployment to TestFlight,
* [x] Continuous Integration with Travis,
* [x] Dependency Injection,
* [x] Code quality measurements:
    * Code coverage,
    * Code quality by [CODEBEAT](https://codebeat.co/).
* [x] Mock auto-generation with Sourcery,
* [x] Playground-driven view development ([original idea](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E51-playground-driven-development-at-kickstarter)),
* [x] Routing pattern (extended coordinator pattern),
* [x] UI interaction/snapshot testing.
